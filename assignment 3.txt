Write a Python program that takes a student's marks in three subjects as input.
If the average is greater than or equal to 90, print "Grade: A".
If the average is between 80 and 89, print "Grade: B".
If the average is between 70 and 79, print "Grade: C".
Otherwise, print "Grade: Fail".

program:
def calculate_grade(marks):
    average = sum(marks) / len(marks)
    if average >= 90:
        return "Grade: A"
    elif 80 <= average < 90:
        return "Grade: B"
    elif 70 <= average < 80:
        return "Grade: C"
    else:
        return "Grade: Fail"

def main():
    marks = []
    for i in range(1, 4):
        mark = float(input(f"Enter marks for subject {i}: "))
        marks.append(mark)
    
    grade = calculate_grade(marks)
    print(grade)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

output:
Enter marks for subject 1: 99
Enter marks for subject 2: 90
Enter marks for subject 3: 96
Grade: A

write a python program to calculate the frequency of each word in a give text. Print the words and their corresponding counts
program:
def word_frequency(text):
    # Remove punctuation and convert text to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    for char in '-.,\n':
        text = text.replace(char, ' ')
    
    # Split the text into words
    words = text.split()
    
    # Create a dictionary to store word frequencies
    word_count = {}
    
    # Count the frequency of each word
    for word in words:
        if word in word_count:
            word_count[word] += 1
        else:
            word_count[word] = 1
    
    # Print the words and their corresponding counts
    for word, count in word_count.items():
        print(f'{word}: {count}')

# Example usage
text = "This is a sample text. This text is just a sample."
word_frequency(text) 
output:
this: 2
is: 2
a: 2
sample: 2
text: 2
just: 1

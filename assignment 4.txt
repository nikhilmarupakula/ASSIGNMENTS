Write a Python program to calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and a given positive integer n

program:
def sum_of_even_numbers(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for number in range(1, n + 1):
        if number % 2 == 0:
            total_sum += number
    
    return total_sum

n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
result = sum_of_even_numbers(n)
print(f"The sum of all even numbers between 1 and {n} is: {result}")

output:
Enter a positive integer: 20
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 20 is: 110
